Thyroid disease is a common endocrine disorder affecting millions of people worldwide. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment and management. In this study, we aimed to develop a machine learning model for predicting the presence or absence of thyroid disease based on patient data. Our dataset consisted of various patient attributes such as age, sex, and medical history, as well as diagnostic test results. We employed several classification algorithms including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Trees to make predictions. The model's performance was evaluated using several performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Our results showed that the SVM model achieved the highest accuracy of 85.42% in predicting the presence or absence of thyroid disease. The developed machine learning model has the potential to aid healthcare professionals in the early detection and diagnosis of thyroid disease, leading to better patient outcomes and improved quality of life.
